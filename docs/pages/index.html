<h1>zap</h1>

<p>
Zap is a Dart-powered web framework. Heavily inspired by <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>, zap makes it
easy to write modular and reactive components:
</p>

<div class="grid">
  <div>
    {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
```html
{{ 'package:zap_docs/src/demo/counter.zap' | readString }}
```
    {% endblock %}
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Preview</h3>
    <div id="index-example-1">
      <em>Loading example</em>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Zap's compiler uses the powerful Dart analyzer to generate efficient components updating their
state without a virtual DOM.
Updates to <code>counter</code> will automatically rebuild parts of the component referring to it.

{% block "blocks/markdown" %}
## Why zap?

Dart is an amazing language for building modern web applications.
Its sound type system helps you catch errors quickly, a well-designed standard library
is so much nicer to use than all the quirks in old web APIs and the powerful `dart2js`
compiler translates your entire app into efficient JavaScript.

Unfortunately, there aren't many frameworks making good use of Dart for small to medium-sized
webapps:
__Flutter Web__ is more suited for full-blown webapps and __AngularDart__ has
effectively been discontinued for public use.
Zap attempts to be a reasonably lightweight framework making it easy to write modular
webapps in Dart.
Zap also works well for websites with just a bit of interactivity, like this static
page embedding some zap components.

Zap embraces Dart at every step and fits perfectly into the ecosystem:
Futures and Streams replace the callback mess you know from JavaScript.
It uses Dart's build system for compilation, so you can easily use it together
with other builders like `freezed`.
Of course, it has builtin support for scoped CSS and Sass.
State management is easy thanks to first-class support for [riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/).

Similar to Svelte, zap uses a smart compiler to make your live easier. Instead
of relying on complex boilerplate or state management techniques, zap makes your Dart
code reactive!

## First steps

Under [getting started]({{ 'create/' | absUrl }}), you can scaffold a new zap project with all
dependencies fully set up.

Also, be sure to checkout the [documentation]({{ 'docs/' | absUrl }}) and a collection of
[examples]({{ 'examples/' | absUrl }}) highlighting common blocks of zap.

## Contributions welcome!

Zap is at a very early stage of development, and I would love for you to play around with it!
At the time, I'm adapting it to my own needs as necessary.

Some things on my todo list are:

- An animation framework, potentially similar to the one from Svelte.
- Support for server-side rendering and hydration.
- Tricks in the compiler to emit much less code.

All kinds of feedback, help or other contributions with these or other features are most welcome!
