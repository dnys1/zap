# zap

A fast, modern and lightweight Dart web framework, inspired by svelte.

Zap is in very early stages of development and still has lots of rough edges.
I'm mostly using it for personal projects, but I think it has the potential
to be an interesting framework for writing Dart web applications.

Some things on my todo list are

- Optimizations in the compiler to reduce code size.
- Server-side rendering and hydration.
- Better documentation.
- A framework for animations and transitions.

Contributions, or help of any kind, are welcome!
