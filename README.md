# zap

A fast, modern and lightweight Dart web framework, inspired by svelte.

For more information, visit https://simonbinder.eu/zap/

Zap is in very early stages of development and still has lots of rough edges.
I'm mostly using it for personal projects, but I think it has the potential
to be an interesting framework for writing Dart web applications.

## Examples

A good way to try out zap is to view small example components built with it:

- [Examples on the website](https://simonbinder.eu/zap/examples/) show zap code and live
  components next to each other. Sources for that website are available [here](https://github.com/simolus3/zap/tree/main/docs/lib/src/examples).
- The [riverpod example](https://github.com/simolus3/zap/tree/main/riverpod_zap/example) provides
  a simple todo app built with zap.

## Getting started

You can download a scaffold for a new zap project at https://simonbinder.eu/zap/create/.

## Contributing

Some things on my todo list are

- Optimizations in the compiler to reduce code size.
- Server-side rendering and hydration.
- Better documentation.
- A framework for animations and transitions.

Contributions, or help of any kind, are welcome!
